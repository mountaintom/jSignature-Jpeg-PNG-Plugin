# jSignature Jpeg PNG plugin

This project creates a plug-in to render JPG (Jpeg) and PNG images from vectors just like the back-end process except it does so in JavaScript on the client.

Modern Mobile App platforms and browsers have the capability to render the signatures to images directly. The plug-in created in this project does that. The plug-in renders an image independent of the jSignature capture size and without the decorations. 

To tryout this plug-in in context go to my jSignature fork and look in the directories listed below.

In the examples directory the unmini.html demo file has been modified to demonstrate this new (jSignature.CompressorRenderedImage.js) plug-in.
